# Magic Leap

### Sia Peng and Angi Li

## What we built

We both have some experience with Oculus & VR but haven't tried AR lenses yet. Hence, for our heack-a-thing 2, we want to explore AR in Magic Leap.

We downloaded package tool for Magic Leap, set up previewing with Unity Play Mode, added Device streaming, and created a Unity Project with corresponding SDK and project settings. We then created a simple scene with a unicorn in it.

Moving on, we also implemented a script that mobilizes the unicorn per user input (Hand Poses/Gestures). Specifically, the unicorn is static initially but it will then be activated once our app recognizes the OK hand pose. Once active, the user can control which direction the unicorn rotates via left or right hand OpenHand, Fist and Finger hand poses.

## Who did What

### Sia
I set up the initial Unity project with customized settings for play in Magic Leap. I also set up the Device and connected it to our project with Previewing with Unity Play Mode. I also added Device Streaming. I also made a unicorn model to be played with.
